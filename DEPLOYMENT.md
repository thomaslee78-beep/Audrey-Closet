# GitHub Pages deployment

This is a static web app. It does not require Node.js, npm, or a build step.

Recommended GitHub Pages setup:
1. Upload the CONTENTS of this folder to the repository root (index.html must be at the root).
2. In Settings > Pages, choose Deploy from a branch.
3. Select main and /(root), then Save.
4. Commit any small change to main to trigger a fresh deployment if needed.

The `.nojekyll` file is included so GitHub Pages serves the static files directly without Jekyll processing.

A Node.js deprecation warning shown by the GitHub-generated Pages workflow is about GitHub Actions runtime dependencies, not this app; this app contains no Node package and no npm dependencies.

### v12.1
This is a bug-fix/refinement release. It uses the same IndexedDB database as v12 and does not intentionally migrate or erase closet data. After GitHub Pages deploys, refresh the Pages URL in Safari once, then close/reopen the Home Screen app.
